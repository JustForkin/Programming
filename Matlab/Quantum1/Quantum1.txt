Quantum Computing, Assignment 1, Programming


To run my MATLAB program, navigate to within the Quantum1 directory 
and type 'matlab' to run matlab.
From within the matlab prompt, type

Quantum1Tester

to run my script, which will display test cases.
To test specific input, either edit the QUantum1Tester script or run my

Quantum1(j, k, m);

function with your own j, k, and m.
(If you try to run my program from within cunix but not from  within the matlab prompt
it may not work).


My program runs in time linear to k, because it solves the problem as follows:
It calculates   <j1 j2 j3...jk | X1 X2 X3...Xk | m1 m2 m3...mk>  by 
computing the product of
<j1 | X1 | m1> * <j2 | X2 | m2> * <j3 | X3 | m3> * ... *  <jk | Xk | mk>
where each individual inner product takes constant time relative to k,
and this is performed k times. (the only for-loop in the code runs till k).
The results are multiplied in k time and the result is complex-magnituded and squared.
