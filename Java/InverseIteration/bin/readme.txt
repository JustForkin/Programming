To run my java program, type
	javac *.java
and then
	java InverseTester
from within the proper directory


I output the error, e'val, and e'vector at each iteration so the final solution (smallest 
e'val) is in the last iteration.

I implemented the Inverse Iteration algorithm as discussed in class with a starting 
unit vector of {1, 0, 0, ..., 0} as the initial approximation of the eigenvector and 
used the software from hw2 to do the step that involved solving a system.
