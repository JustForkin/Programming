Programming #3

To run my program, type
	javac *.java
from inside the src folder to compile the java files, and then type
	java MatrixTester <inputFile>
to run the program where <inputFile> is the matrix you wish to solve


My program will solve the Ax=b system and output to the terminal each step along the way.
I use half-pivoting to reduce the floating point errors my program will come across.


EXAMPLE SOLUTIONS  (My actual program itself outputs each step along the way to the solution)

1) Infinite Solutions:
~input:
4
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4 4 4 4
1
2

4
~output:
There are infinite solutions.
Particular solution:

0.0
0.0
0.0
0.0
0.0
0.0

Special solutions (as column vectors):
-1.0   -1.0   -1.0   -1.0   -1.0   -1.0   
1.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   
0.0   1.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   
0.0   0.0   1.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   
0.0   0.0   0.0   1.0   0.0   0.0
