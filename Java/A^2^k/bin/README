To compile and run my (java) program in cunix, run the commands 
'javac *.java' 
and then 
'java A2kTester inputFile outputFile'  
from within the A^2^k/src directory 
(or wherever you choose to put the .java and text [input/README/etc] files).

My program's main method (located in A2kTester.java) creates a SquareMatrix (n*n) and 
then squares it 'k' times in order to produce A^2^k with only 'k' multiplications.  
It uses 3 nested for-loops to perform the multiplication which costs O(n^3).  
Both classes are commented with JavaDoc.
