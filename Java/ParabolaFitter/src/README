Programming hw#4

To run my program, type
	javac *.java 
from inside the src/ folder to compile, and then type
	java ParabolaTester <inputFile>
to run my program, where <inputFile> contains m, C, D, E on different lines in that order

My algorithm works by computing A_trans * A,  A_trans * b, and then uses them 
to solve for x(^) with GJ elim since
The partial derivatives of ||Ax-b||^2 = 0 when
(A_trans) * (A) * (x_^) = (A_trans) * (b)

sample input:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
20
5

output:  m, old coefficients, new coefficients
~~~~~~
m: 20
C: 5.0
D: 6.0
E: 7.0
C': 5.072019676344359
D': 5.9498128335046125
