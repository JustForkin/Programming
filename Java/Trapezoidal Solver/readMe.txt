for HW#19: 

Run the SampleTrapTester file to apply the general TrapSolver to the sailing problem where
 H=b=10, a=0, e=.001.  
 Or run the more general TrapTester to input your own initial values.
The program uses a given tolerance and initial points a,b and creates 
a TrapSolver object which uses those values as well as an object which extends 
the Function class to run the Trapezoidal solver algorithm.  

B. The outputted approximation is 197.0233413026044 (for the given conditions & H)
which is within .00000001 of 197.02334138264757
