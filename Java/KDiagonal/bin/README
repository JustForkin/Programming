To compile and run my (JAVA) program in cunix, navigate to the KDiagonal/src directory 
(or wherever you choose to put the .java and text [input/README/etc] files)
and then type:
	javac *.java
and then
	java KDiagTester inputFile outputFile
where 'inputFile' is the file containing your n,k,[A|b] and 'outputFile' is where
the solution will be put
(it will also be printed to the console, in addition to steps along the way).
(The input_file is formatted the same way as on the last assignment.)

I created 2 inputFiles (inputFile & inputFile2) so you can test the cases of n=5 and k=3,5
	
My program's main method creates a k-diagonal square augmented matrix. It then performs
elimination [which costs O(n)] and back substitution on it [which costs O(n)] to
produce the solution to the system. Because the matrices are k-diagonal, elim and
back-sub cost less they would normally for an unbounded matrix O(n^3) and O(n^2)
respectively.  My program then prints the solution and steps along the way to the
console, as well as outputs the solution to a text file specified in the last commandline argument.
(For more info on the code, see the javadoc and comments.)
