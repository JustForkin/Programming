Balloon:

No input is required. Simply run the BalloonTester and it will create a balloon, add 100cm^3 of air to it, calculate and display the volume, radius and surface area, as per the instructions, and then perform this task again on the same balloon. There wasn't much freedom to be had with this program.

CreditCard:

Input an 8 digit credit card number. Run the CreditCardTester file and it will check to see if the number you entered is a valid by using the methods in CreditCard.credit card number. 
sum1() adds every other digit starting with rightmost
sum2() performs it's algorithm on the other numbers
sum() combines the two sums
addDig   a piece of one of the algorithms; it adds digits of number
sumValid()  checks if the check digit is valid. If not, returns the value it should be. If it is valid, returns -1 which is an impossible value for the check digit so that tester class knows it was valid.
Breaking this program up into small steps was very helpful.

Factor:

run FactorPrinter which will use the methods in FactorGenerator.  
nextFactor()  tells what next factor is by testing the mod of your number with small ints
hasMoreFactors()   returns whether or not the number has more factors based on whether it's prime or not (and special cases)
factorize()  combines above methods to loop through and print out factors of input.
Following the instructions and adding a method to use the ones required made this program easier.
