HW #20 and EC #9

This program outputs everything needed for HW20 and EC9.

Run the McTester class to test your own input or n= 10^2...10^6 for pseudo random numbers
generated with Math.random() and true random numbers generated by Random.org.
First the equation was converted by using a linear change of variables to turn the limits of
integration into the unit cube. i.e. the triple integral of (0.5*e^(x+y+1+0.5*z)dx dy dz). This is "MyFunction." 
"ExactFunction" is the function used in part B of HW#20.
The function converges to 5.206446553838018
B) The error does indeed converge as 1/sqrt(n) for both true random and pseudorandom
numbers (check the output).
As per the extra credit, pseudorandom and true random numbers basically give the same answers
(but they get closer together as you approach a higher n since their order of magnitude decreases).
